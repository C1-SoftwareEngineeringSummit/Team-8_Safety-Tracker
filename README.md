# SafetyOne
Project for the Capital One August 2019 hackathon

# General Functionalities
Android Application that monitors the financial habits and actively helps improve them by cutting on unnecessary spending
Customer sets personal deadlines based on the application's suggestions and agrees to locking their card if they go above the set limit behind unnecessary purchases (e.g. alcohol, $10 starbucks, and candies everyday), without impacting credit score or transaction ability in other categories.
The block can be lifted by depositing more money in the account of that particular category.

# Technologies Used
-Android Studio (Java and XML)
-Capital One API

# Competitor note
Certain platforms do provide a similar service; however, there is no existing platform to put holds and actvely encourage wise spending without causing any unwanted inconvenience and security to emergency situations with easy transfer options. Thhis feature distinguishes our project: M-Money, from other minty projects.
